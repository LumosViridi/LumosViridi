# Welcome to my GitHub Profile

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing Hashicorp Vault on my Raspberry Pi cluster!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go and will be adding some fun projects in here soon!
- ðŸ†• Most of what I work on is in a private GitHub org and will be moving things here as I have time. If you are curious about something that you see here just ask!

## Current Home Lab

- 4 Rasperry Pis running k3s
- Synology NAS
- Ubiquiti Unifi Dream Machine Router
  - VLANs running for IoT Devices, Gaming, and Servers

## Terraform

I love Terraform and use it in a lot of different places

- **My Website**
  - I use terraform to manage all configuration and website files. This allows me to keep my website up to date easily.
- **Kubernetes**
  - After years of typing "kubectl create" and "kubectl delete" I decided to manage all my K3s deployments with Terraform. I love how much easier it is to read and it removes a lot of room for human error.
- **Minecraft on AWS Fargate**
  - When I came up with the idea to create a Minecraft world and host it on AWS Fargate I found a great project by [doctorray117](https://github.com/doctorray117/minecraft-ondemand). Once I had played around in the console and learned more about Fargate, I decided to manage it with Terraform. Since then I have turned it into a module so I can easily create new worlds and I now have a repeatable template I can use if I decide to spin this up again in the future.
